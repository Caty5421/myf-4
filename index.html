        <div class="line"></div>
        <p class="para">My hobby is reading interesting and knowledgeable books in my free time. Whenever I go to home from my school I like to read such books after completing my home work. I am 12 years old and read in class 7th standard. Now I know very well that reading is very good habit which can make me a complete. This hobby can be developed by anyone however I got this naturally. Reading books keep one always happy and busy. It is the good source of enjoyment, knowledge, inspiration and instruction. It makes us disciplined, loyal, punctual and most importantly a successful person in the life.

        <h5> Review on Aladdin</h5>
        <img src="Aladdin%20Pic.jpg">
        <p> A very straight forward, big spectacle musical. It's bizarre in a way that's sometimes funny-bad and sometimes just bad-bad. Everything about Aladdin is big, and yet feels small at the same time. Its lavish production design and costuming also has the effect of looking more like a stage production than an epic movie.</p>

        <h5> Review on Snow White</h5>
        <img src="Snow White pic.jpg">
        <p> Kids will like the film most because of the Dwarfs' hilarious antics. ... Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs may not be the best example of a Disney classic, thanks mainly to its lightly-plotted story, but with great animation, memorable characters, and beautiful music, it still remains one of their most endearing films.</p>

        <5> Review on Zootopia</5>
        <img src="zootopia%20pic.jpg">
        <p>Reviews of Zootopia, Disney's new animated detective story about a rabbit cop, a con artist fox, and the animal-filled city they call home, have been overwhelmingly positive. The film's box office has been great too, with an opening weekend of more than $73 million in the US and Canada alone.</p>
